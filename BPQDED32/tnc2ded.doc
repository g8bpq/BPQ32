                          AX.25 Version 2
                           Multi-channel
                           TNC  FIRMWARE

                           (version 2.5)

             Copyright 1987, 1989 Ronald E. Raikes (WA8DED)

      This firmware supports the full AX.25  link-layer  protocol,
 version 2.0 as described in the ARRL specification dated  October
 1984,  as  well  as   the   pre-existing   version   1.x.    This
 implementation supports multiple  simultaneous  link  connections
 with either version protocol.  This release has been compiled for
 a maximum of four connections, although any reasonable number  of
 connections is possible by changing  one  MAXLNK  symbol  in  the
 source header file.  The  firmware  is  contained  in  one  26256
 EPROM, and is intended to  be  installed  in  a  TAPR  TNC-2  (or
 equivalent, such as the MFJ-1270 or AEA  PK-80)  in  socket  U23.
 RAM memory is automatically sized, supporting both  16k  and  32k
 configurations.

      Commands and information are sent to the tnc in the form  of
 lines.  Lines may be up to 256  characters  long,  including  the
 terminating CARRIAGE RETURN.  If the 256th character  entered  is
 not a CARRIAGE RETURN, it will be discarded and a BELL  character
 will be output to the terminal.  BACKSPACE and DELETE may be used
 to remove single characters from the line.  The entire  line  may
 be permanently backspaced out by entering a CONTROL-U or CONTROL-
 X.  A CONTROL-R will temporarily backspace out any  partial  line
 to allow incoming frames to be  displayed.   A  second  CONTROL-R
 will then restore  the  line  to  allow  continuation  of  entry.
 During the time a partial line is saved, only  another  CONTROL-R
 will be  accepted  from  the  keyboard  (with  the  exception  of
 xon/xoff, of course).  BELL characters are echoed to the terminal
 when entered or  removed.   Lines  which  begin  with  an  ESCAPE
 character (echoed as '* ') are interpreted  as  commands.   If  a
 command is issued with no parameter, the current  value  of  that
 commands parameter is displayed.  Lines without a leading  ESCAPE
 character are sent as information.

      The firmware provides the operator  with  five  virtual  tnc
 channels, numbered 0 to 4.  The terminal is logically attached to
 only one of these  channels  at  a  time,  selected  by  the  'S'
 command.  Information sent on channel 0 is always  unproto.   The
 unproto path may be set by issuing a 'C' command when  channel  0
 is selected.  Channels 1 - 4 are also unproto  if  they  are  not
 currently connected.  Outgoing connect requests may be issued  on
 any unconnected channel, while incoming connect requests will use
 the first available  channel  (provided  the  maximum  number  of
 connections set  by  the  'Y'  command  will  not  be  exceeded).
 Information received on a connected channel that is not currently
 selected will remain queued there until that channel is selected.
 The STA led indicates there is queued information,  and  the  'L'
 command may be used to  determine  the  channel(s)  where  it  is
 located.  Information  for  transmission  is  sent  only  to  the
 currently selected channel.  When a connection is ended, received
 information will remain queued until it has been displayed.  If a
 new digipeater path  is  desired  while  a  connection  is  being
 established or is in progress, it is not necessary to  disconnect
 first.  Simply re-issuing the 'C' command will  re-establish  the
 connection via the new path without any loss of information.

      Which protocol version is used to initiate a  connection  is
 controlled by the 'V' command, but the version  will  be  changed
 automatically, if necessary, to conform to the version of the tnc
 responding.  Version 2 protocol is more  effecient  in  terms  of
 network  throughput  and   loading,   especially   under   severe
 conditions.  Version 2 protocol is the default and should be used
 whenever possible.  When version 2 protocol is used, a  watch-dog
 timer is started whenever information is not  being  transmitted.
 If the tnc remains idle for three minutes, it will poll the other
 tnc to determine  if  the  link  is  still  established.   If  no
 response is received after the number of tries  set  by  the  'N'
 command, a link failure is reported.  This  procedure  will  also
 detect the case where someone connects and  then  leaves  without
 disconnecting.  Changing the protocol version during a connection
 is not permitted.

      The 'F', 'I', 'N', 'O', and 'V' commands maintain individual
 parameters for each channel.  The value stored in  channel  0  is
 used to initialize channels 1 - 4  upon  power  up,  and  to  re-
 initialize channels 1 - 4 after a disconnect.   This  allows  the
 values to be changed independently on each channel, prior to  and
 during a connection, and then automatically revert  back  to  the
 standard values when the connection  is  ended.   A  'D'  command
 issued on a disconnected channel 1 - 4  will  also  re-initialize
 that channel.

      Frame monitoring is controlled  by  the  'M'  command.   The
 command parameter determines the types of frames  monitored,  and
 is a list of desired  frames  chosen  from  the  letters  in  the
 following table:

      LTR       FRAME
      ---       -----
       N        None
       I        I frames
       U        UI frames
       S        Supervisory frames
       C        Monitor while connected
       +        Call signs to be included (maximum of 8)
       -        Call signs to be excluded (maximum of 8)

 The '+' and '-' parameters may not be used together.   If  either
 is used, it must be the last parameter (followed by one to  eight
 callsigns, if applicable).  If no list of callsigns is  specified
 to be included or excluded, all callsigns will be candidates  for
 monitoring.  Entering a '+' or '-' with no callsigns  will  empty
 the list.

 An asterisk displayed after a callsign  in  the  digipeater  list
 indicates the frame was transmitted by that station.  The control
 field displayed will be one of the following:

      NAME   DESCRIPTION
      ----   -----------
      RRa  - Receive Ready
      RNRa - Receive Not Ready
      REJa - Reject
      UI   - Unnumbered Information
      DM   - Disconnected Mode
      SABM - Connect Request
      DISC - Disconnect Request
      UA   - Unnumbered Acknowledge
      FRMR - Frame Reject
      Iab  - Information
      ?ccH - Unknown
      a  = Next expected frame number (0 - 7)
      b  = Frame number of this frame (0 - 7)
      cc = Hexadecimal value

 In addition, one of the following characters will  be  displayed,
 reflecting the protocol version, command/response bits,  and  the
 poll/final bit:
  (blank) = version 1 frame without poll/final bit
        ! = version 1 frame with poll/final bit
        ^ = version 2 command frame without poll bit
        + = version 2 command frame with poll bit
        - = version 2 response frame with final bit
        v = version 2 response frame without final bit

 The protocol identifier field is displayed in hexadecimal

      An unattended mode, controlled by the 'U' command,  provides
 for sending user supplied text to a connecting station, and  then
 allows that station to leave a  brief  message.   This  mode  can
 operate on all channels simultaneously, but in no way limits  the
 operators ability to interact with one of the connected  channels
 or  the  ability  to  make  outgoing  connect   requests.    When
 unattended mode is enabled, link status messages  are  queued  to
 the associated channel and not output to the terminal unless that
 channel  is  currently  selected.   Link  status  messages   will
 therefore  be  displayed  in   chronological   order   with   the
 information from that channel.  In addition, text supplied by the
 user with the 'U' command  will  be  sent  to  any  station  that
 connects.  If channel 0  is  left  selected,  stations  may  then
 connect and leave messages on channels 1 - 4 (limited by the  'Y'
 parameter, of course).  The 'L' command may be used to  determine
 if messages have been left on any channel.  Selecting  a  channel
 containing messages will cause all link  status  and  information
 from that channel to be displayed.  If  xon/xoff  handshaking  is
 enabled, CONTROL-S and CONTROL-Q may  be  used  to  regulate  the
 output to the terminal to allow comfortable reading.

                        COMMAND DESCRIPTION
                        ===================

      The 'A' command is used to enable or disable  the  automatic
 insertion of LINEFEED characters after CARRIAGE RETURN characters
 to the terminal.

      The 'C' command is used to initiate a link connection.  Note
 that 'v' or 'via' is not required (but is  allowed)  between  the
 destination callsign and the digipeater callsigns.  A 'C' command
 may be  issued  on  a  channel  already  in  use  to  change  the
 digipeater callsigns, but not the destination  callsign.   A  'C'
 command issued when channel 0 is selected sets the unproto path.

      The 'D' command is used to initiate  a  link  disconnection.
 If there is unsent or unacknowledged information  remaining,  the
 disconnect request frame will not be sent until  all  information
 has been transmitted and acknowledged.  No additional information
 will be received after the 'D' command has been issued.  A second
 'D' command may be entered  to  force  the  transmission  of  the
 disconnect request frame before all information has been sent and
 acknowledged.  A 'D' command issued during the establishment of a
 link or after a disconnect request  frame  has  been  transmitted
 will cause an immediate return to the disconnected state.  A  'D'
 command issued on a disconnected channel will  re-initialize  the
 connection dependent parameters to the values stored  in  channel
 0.

      The 'E' command is used to enable or disable the echoing  of
 input (commands and information) to the terminal.

      The 'F' command is used to  set  the  frame  acknowledgement
 interval.  This interval is used to compute the timeout  interval
 before a packet is retransmitted, using the formula:
      time (seconds) = frame ack * (2 * number of digipeaters + 1)
 A separate frame acknowlegement interval value is maintained  for
 each connection channel.  The value stored in channel 0  is  used
 to  initialize  each  connection  channel  upon   power   up   or
 disconnection.

      The 'G' command is used to interrogate virtual tnc  channels
 when host mode is enabled.  If no  parameter  is  specified,  the
 next chronological item (information  or  link  status)  will  be
 returned, provided there is one.   This  command  is  invalid  in
 terminal  mode.   A  later  section  is  devoted  to  host   mode
 operation.

      The 'I' command is used to set the tnc source callsign.  The
 initial value is all blanks.  Changing the  tnc  source  callsign
 while connected is not permitted.  If the tnc source callsign  is
 left blank, the tnc will not allow connect  commands  or  unproto
 transmissions.  The callsign stored  in  channel  0  is  used  to
 initialize   each   connection   channel   upon   power   up   or
 disconnection.

      The 'JHOST' command is used to select between  terminal  and
 host modes.  A later section is devoted to host mode operation.

      The 'L' command is used to display the link status of one or
 all channels.   Information  displayed  includes  the  connection
 path, number of receive frames not yet displayed, number of  send
 frames not yet transmitted, number of transmitted frames not  yet
 acknowledged, and the  current  retry  count.   A  '+'  character
 preceeding the channel number indicates  the  currently  selected
 channel.  Operation of this command when host mode is enabled  is
 somewhat different, and is described in a later section.

      The 'M' command is used to set the  frame  monitoring  mode.
 The command parameter determines the types of  frames  monitored,
 and is a list of desired frames chosen from the  letters  in  the
 following table:

      LTR       FRAME
      ---       -----
       N        None
       I        I frames
       U        UI frames
       S        Supervisory frames
       C        Monitor while connected
       +        Call signs to be included (maximum of 8)
       -        Call signs to be excluded (maximum of 8)

 The '+' and '-' parameters may not be used together.   If  either
 is used, it must be the last parameter (followed by one to  eight
 callsigns, if applicable).  If no list of callsigns is  specified
 to be included or excluded, all callsigns will be candidates  for
 monitoring.  Entering a '+' or '-' with no callsigns  will  empty
 the list.

      The 'N' command is used to set the maximum number of times a
 frame  will  be  transmitted  without  receiving  an  appropriate
 acknowledgement, before a link failure is  assumed.   A  separate
 maximum number of tries value is maintained for  each  connection
 channel.  The value stored in channel 0  is  used  to  initialize
 each connection channel upon power up or disconnection.

      The 'O' command  is  used  to  set  the  maximum  number  of
 unacknowledged I frames that may be outstanding at any one  time.
 A separate maximum number of unacknowledged  I  frames  value  is
 maintained for each connection  channel.   The  value  stored  in
 channel 0 is used to  initialize  each  connection  channel  upon
 power up or disconnection.

      The 'P' command is used to set the p-persistence value.   P-
 persistence is used  during  simplex  operation  as  a  means  of
 channel  arbitration.   Whenever   there   are   frames   to   be
 transmitted, the tnc first waits for a clear channel.   Once  the
 channel is clear, a random number between 0 and 255 is generated.
 If the random number is less than or equal to  the  p-persistence
 value,  the  PTT  line  is  asserted  and  transmission   begins.
 Otherwise, the tnc delays for the slot time interval set  by  the
 'W' command and the entire process is repeated.

      The  'QRES'  command  is  used  to  restart  the   firmware,
 including re-initialization  of  battery-backed  RAM  to  default
 parameters.

      The 'R' command is used to enable or disable the digipeating
 of frames.

      The 'S' command  is  used  to  select  the  current  channel
 number.

      The 'T' command is used to set the transmitter  keyup  delay
 interval.  The parameter is specified in 10ms increments.

      The 'U' command is used  to  enable  or  disable  unattended
 modes.

      The 'V' command is used to select whether  version  1  or  2
 protocol will be used to initiate a link connection.  A  separate
 protocol version value is maintained for each connection channel.
 The value  stored  in  channel  0  is  used  to  initialize  each
 connection channel upon power up or disconnection.  Interrogating
 this parameter during a  connection  will  reflect  the  protocol
 version currently being  used  on  that  channel.   Changing  the
 protocol version during a connection is not permitted.

      The 'W' command is used to set the p-persistence  slot  time
 interval.  P-persistence is used during simplex  operation  as  a
 means of channel arbitration.  Whenever there are  frames  to  be
 transmitted, the tnc first waits for a clear channel.   Once  the
 channel is clear, a random number between 0 and 255 is generated.
 If the random number is less than or equal to  the  p-persistence
 value set by the 'P'  command,  the  PTT  line  is  asserted  and
 transmission begins.  Otherwise, the tnc delays for the slot time
 interval and the entire process is repeated.   The  parameter  is
 specified in 10ms increments.

      The 'X' command is used to enable or disable the transmitter
 PTT line.

      The 'Y' command  is  used  to  set  the  maximum  number  of
 connections that may  established  by  incoming  requests.   This
 command has no  effect  on  the  operators  ability  to  initiate
 outgoing connection requests.

      The 'Z' command is used to enable or  disable  flow  control
 and xon/xoff handshaking to the terminal.   If  flow  control  is
 enabled, output to the terminal will be inhibited while  entering
 commands or information.  If flow control is disabled, output  to
 the terminal will not be restricted.  Flow control  and  xon/xoff
 handshaking should be disabled during periods in which the tnc is
 operated without a terminal, to  avoid  suspending  output  which
 will consume buffers.  If xon/xoff handshaking  is  enabled,  crt
 scrolling may be stopped and started using CONTROL-S and CONTROL-
 Q characters.  Flow control  and  xon/xoff  handshaking  are  not
 performed when host mode is enabled.

      The '@'  command  is  a  software  maintenance  command.   A
 parameter of 'B' will display the number of  free  buffers.   The
 'D' parameter is used to enable or disable full duplex  operation
 of the HDLC port.  A parameter of 'S' will  display  the  current
 link state.  The 'T2' parameter is  used  to  set  the  timer  T2
 interval, just as the 'T3' parameter is used to set the timer  T3
 interval.  The timer intervals are specified in 10ms  increments.
 Timer T2 controls  the  amount  of  delay  between  the  time  an
 information frame is received and the time the resulting response
 frame  is  sent.   This  delay  allows  multiple  frames  to   be
 acknowledged with a single response.  Timer T3 is  used  maintain
 link integrity.  If there is no activity during the T3  interval,
 the tnc  will  poll  to  verify  the  distant  station  is  still
 connected.  The 'V'  parameter  is  used  to  enable  or  disable
 callsign validation.


                        HOST MODE OPERATION
                        ===================

      Host mode is intended to provide a user  interface  suitable
 for operation under control of a host  processor.   Commands  and
 information to the tnc, as well as status  and  information  from
 the tnc, are clearly identified to allow orderly and  unambiguous
 communication.  To alleviate any need for  hardware  or  software
 handshaking,  the  tnc  will  not  send  to  the  host  processor
 unsolicited,  and  all  exchanges  are  limited  to  256   bytes.
 Information transfers are fully transparent.

      When host mode is enabled, the first byte sent  to  the  tnc
 must be a channel number.  If  information  is  being  sent,  the
 second byte must be a binary 0.  If a command is being sent,  the
 second byte must be a binary 1.   The  third  byte  must  be  the
 binary length of the actual information or  command,  decremented
 by 1 (vacuous information or commands are  not  permitted).   The
 actual  information  or   command   bytes   must   follow   last.
 Information sent to channel 0 will be sent unproto.   Information
 sent to an unconnected channel 1 - 4 will be discarded.  The  tnc
 will respond to both information  and  commands  with  a  channel
 number first, followed by a binary code of 0, 1, or 2, signalling
 success or failure.  Codes of 1 or 2 will be followed by  a  null
 terminated message.  Channels may be  interrogated  for  incoming
 information or link status by using  the  'G'  command.   Monitor
 headers and monitor information will always be sent to channel 0,
 along with connect request link status messages.  All other  link
 status messages will be sent to the  appropriate  channel,  along
 with that channels connected information.  In response to  a  'G'
 command, the tnc  will  respond  with  a  channel  number  first,
 followed by a binary code of 0 if  nothing  is  available,  or  a
 binary code of 3 - 7, identifying the bytes that follow.  A  code
 of  4  indicates  the  monitored  frame  does  not   contain   an
 information field.  A code of 5  indicates  the  monitored  frame
 does contain an information field, and the next  'G'  command  on
 channel 0 will return that information field, preceeded by a code
 of 6.

 f = Link state
     Possible link states are:
      0 = Disconnected
      1 = Link Setup
      2 = Frame Reject
      3 = Disconnect Request
      4 = Information Transfer

 NOTE 1:  Only items a and b are displayed for channel 0.
 NOTE 2:  Only states 0 - 4 are possible if version 1 is in use.

                        DEFAULT PARAMETERS
                        ==================
      In some instances, it  may  be  desirable  to  have  default
 parameters which differ from the standard values.  To allow  easy
 access, all default parameters have been placed at the  beginning
 of the EPROM at location 0040H.  The  following  listing  defines
 the layout of this area:

      TYPE     VALUE          DESCRIPTION

      WORD     4650H          TIMER T3 INTERVAL (10ms)
   DISABLE = 00H / ENABLE = 01H

 NOTE 1:  The secondary station id must be shifted  left  one  bit
 and or'ed with 60H.

 NOTE 2:  The monitor mode is composed from the following bits:
      BIT       FRAME
      ---       -----
       0        I frames
       1        UI frames
       2        Supervisory frames
       3        Monitor while connected
